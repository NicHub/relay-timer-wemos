# RELAY TIMER WEMOS

This is a simple timer project with a WEMOS D1 mini / ESP8266.
The goal is to open a relay during a given time.
The opening can be triggered by a button or with the serial interface.
The time can be changed with the serial interface and it is stored on flash so that the time must not be configured each time the microcontroler is restarted.
